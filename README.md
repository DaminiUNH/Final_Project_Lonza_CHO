This repository contains the final project for BIOL 806: Data Science for Life Sciences.  
The analysis focuses on growth kinetics and viability of CHO CRL-3440 cells under multiple shake-flask conditions in collaboration with Lonza.

## Contents

- `Final_Project_Lonza_CHO.Rmd` — R Markdown source with full analysis  
- `Final_Project_Lonza_CHO.pdf` — knitted scientific-style manuscript  
- `lonza_data.csv` — dataset used in the analysis  

## Methods

The project uses:

- `tidyverse` for data cleaning and wrangling  
- `ggplot2` for visualizations  
- Linear regression (`lm`) for modeling the relationship between agitation speed and specific growth rate  
- Summary tables and diagnostics for model evaluation
